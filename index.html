          From Portland, Maine to Portland, Oregon we're going to take you on an exciting journey through some unknown
          regions of your country. Leave the car at home and travel by bike starting in New England where it all began.
          You will pass through 12 beautiful states, covering a total of 3,600 miles, and accomplish 3 monumental
          missions. Partying and taking a selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1 to a billionaire to help eradicate
          polio in Africa, and even stopping by famous author Stephen King's house to say hi and asking him to sign your
          favorite book.</p>

              and
              highly underrated state
              full of rich history and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you want to be sure not to miss.
              As your journey is going to be a long one, you had best be prepared for an arduous trek.
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European settlers on US
              territory in the era of
              Vikings, but is also home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy backpack from for
              your 3-month expedition.

              Hampshire. As serene and
              beautiful as it was in the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled than its neighbors to the South.
              So
              enjoy it while it lasts.</p>

            <p class="place__paragraph">You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense to pick up
              some
              extra footwear?
              Fortunately for you, the best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails from this
              state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to
              keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by while passing through the
              Appalachians. These boots are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.

              reasons for going down in
              history. Since the late 1800s Schenectady, “The City that Lights and Hauls the World,” has been home to
              the
              world-famous General Electric Company.
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">This is where modern power generators were born as well as contemporary means of
              transmitting energy. So we
              figured this would be the perfect place to find a batteryless dynamo light for your bicycle to help you
              see
              through those dark lonely roads on your adventure. Such a light from GE will set you back about $10-20.

              from time to time, is
              another town worth passing through for several different reasons. While it might be most famously known as
              the scene of the Gettysburg address delivered by Mr. Lincoln during the Civil war, Pennsylvania also has
              produced a rather decent-sized Amish community (eerie, huh?)
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't already guessed, can be
              summed up by using one
              delicious word: chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company. Most likely, one of the tastiest
              missions you'll ever embark on during this tour, try to find an Amish friend and enjoy a bar in the
              National
              Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and have an extra eerie time!
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">The current cost of a Hershey's Chocolate bar: about 60¢.</p>

              a truly hidden gem.
              Earthquakes are surprisingly common in this particular region of North America, over 200 of which have
              registered with a magnitude of 2 or higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the only thing shaking
              this centrally located state. One of the country's largest and oldest roller coaster parks is waiting to
              ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most thrilling quests you'll ever
              complete (provided you can stomach it). Take a much-deserved break to ride as many roller coasters as you
              can before continue your bike ride!
